  FORM NOT RECEIVING EMAILS? DO THIS ONCE
============================================

The form now uses your email (elrichtrading2006@gmail.com) so 
FormSubmit can send you an ACTIVATION link. Until you activate, 
no emails are delivered.

STEP 1 – Trigger activation
   • Open your live website and go to the Contact section.
   • Fill the form and click "Send Request".
   • You should see "Request Sent!" on the page.

STEP 2 – Activate (required once)
   • Check the inbox for: elrichtrading2006@gmail.com
   • Check the SPAM / JUNK folder as well.
   • Find the email from FormSubmit with subject like 
     "Activate your form" or "Confirm your email".
   • Open it and click the ACTIVATION LINK in the email.

STEP 3 – Done
   • After you click the link, future form submissions will 
     be delivered to:
     - elrichtrading2006@gmail.com (main)
     - joemarbragas123@gmail.com (CC)

If you never see the activation email:
   • Add noreply@formsubmit.co to your contacts and try again.
   • Use a different browser or device and submit the form again.
   • Wait a few minutes and check spam again.

After activation, you can switch back to the token in the form 
action if you want to hide your email (optional).
